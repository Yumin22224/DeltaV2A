# Delta Correspondence Experiment Configuration
# Goal: Verify semantic correspondence between ΔV (image effects) and ΔA (audio effects)

# Data configuration
data:
  root_dir: "data/experiment"

  # Subdirectories for raw data
  # TODO: Place your data here
  image_subdir: "images"   # Landscape images
  audio_subdir: "audio"    # 4-bar electronic music clips (WAV/MP3)

  # Limits for processing
  max_images: 100
  max_audio: 100

  # Audio settings
  sample_rate: 16000

# Effect configuration
effects:
  # Intensity levels: low, mid, high
  intensities:
    - "low"
    - "mid"
    - "high"

  # Image effects
  image:
    types:
      - "brightness"  # +10%, +25%, +40%
      - "contrast"    # +10%, +25%, +40%
      - "saturation"  # +10%, +25%, +40%
      - "blur"        # sigma 1.0, 2.0, 3.0

  # Audio effects
  audio:
    types:
      - "lpf"         # cutoff 10k, 6k, 3k Hz
      - "highshelf"   # +2, +5, +8 dB at 8kHz
      - "saturation"  # drive +3, +6, +9 dB
      - "reverb"      # wet 10%, 25%, 40%

# Hypothesized effect type mapping (for retrieval evaluation)
# Image effect -> Audio effect
effect_mapping:
  blur: "lpf"              # Blur ↔ Low-pass (both reduce high-frequency content)
  brightness: "highshelf"  # Brightness ↔ High-shelf (both affect "brightness")
  contrast: "saturation"   # Contrast ↔ Saturation (both affect dynamic range/richness)
  saturation: "reverb"     # Saturation ↔ Reverb (tentative)

# Model configuration
model:
  name: "imagebind"
  embed_dim: 1024

# Statistical analysis
n_permutations: 1000

# Device
device: "mps"  # or "cuda" or "cpu"

# Output configuration
